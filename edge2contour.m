% -This function gets the soft edge-map and some parameters and returns the binary contour-map.
% -parameters:
%    -softmap: Input soft-map that is computed by an arbitrary edge detection method.
%    -tho: Initial threshold, The pixels that are higher than this threshold are considered as edge segments.
%    -n: Size of NoN-classical Receptive Field (Markov blanket), An nÃ—n square centered at the position of each edge segment.
%    -theta: Parameter vector of the energy fuctions, Should be tuned according to edge detection method.
% 
% -Following steps is considered:
%     -Detecting initial edge segments by applying a threshold th0 to the soft values.
%     -The orientation of the edge segments are computed from the binary image employing the skeleton orientation method.
%       (http://github.com/tsogkas/matlab-utils/blob/master/skeletonOrientation.m)
%     -Using the edge segments descriptor, position and orientation, we construct a CRF. (Conditional Random Field)
%     -Using the maximum a posteriori inference for computing the best contour integration.
%       (This is solved by Graph-Cut in our framework: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21310-maxflow?s_tid=mwa_osa_a)
