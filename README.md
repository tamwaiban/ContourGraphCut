Matlab implementation of Contour Integration using Graph-Cut and Non-Classical Receptive Field

We proposed a graph-based framework that gets the soft-value of other methods as its input and creates more meaningful contours. Inspired by the concept of non-classical receptive fields in the primary visual cortex, we considered important factors such as connectivity, smoothness, and length of the contour beside the soft-values.
